Ex 4:

A practical application where syntactic and dependency parsing is very useful is in chatbots and virtual assistants, such as Alexa, Siri, or Google Assistant.
These programs need to understand what the user is saying in natural language, not just look for specific keywords. Very often, two sentences can use the same words but mean completely different things depending on their order and structure.

For example, the sentences “Remind me to call John tomorrow” and “Call me John tomorrow” look similar, but they have totally different meanings. A dependency parser can see that in the first sentence, John is the person who needs to be called, while in the second sentence, John is the name the user wants to be called by.

Through this kind of analysis, a chatbot can better understand who performs the action, who it is directed at, and what the user’s intention is — for instance, whether it’s a request, a question, or a statement.
